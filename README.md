# Homeless-Shelter-Finder
This was a project for my CS2340 class. It is an Android application for finding homeless shelters in the area, all stored in a Firebase. The application contains admin and user modes, allowing admins to add new shelters and users to find shelters in the area. This app also uses Google Maps to find the listed shelters. Additional functionality includes user/admin authentication, the ability to book a room in a shelter (also keeps track of the number of rooms available), and the ability to view shelters without an account.
